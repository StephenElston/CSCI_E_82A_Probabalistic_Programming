    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge you will apply Monte Carlo reinforcement learning algorithms to a classic problem in reinforcement learning, known as the **cliff walking problem**. The cliff walking problem is a type of game. The goal is for the agent to find the highest reward (lowest cost) path from a starting state to the goal.   \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of versions of the cliff walking problems which have been used as research benchmarks over the years. You can find a short discussion of the cliff walking problem on page 132 of Sutton and Barto, second edition.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In the general cliff walking problem the agent starts in one corner of the state-space and must travel to goal, or terminal state, in another corner of the state-space. Between the starting state and goal state there is an area with a **cliff**. If the agent falls off a cliff it is sent back to the starting state. A schematic diagram of the state-space is shown in the diagram below.      \n",

    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent must learn a policy to navigate from the starting state to the terminal state. The properties this problem are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The state-space has two **continuous variables**, x and y.\n",
    "2. The starting state is at $x = 0.0$, $y = 0.0$. \n",
    "3. The terminal state has two segments:\n",
    "  - At $y = 0.0$ is in the range $9.0 \\le x \\le 10.0$. \n",
    "  - At $x = 10.0$ is in the range $0.0 \\le y \\le 1.0$.  \n",
    "4. The cliff zone is bounded by:\n",
    "  - $0.0 \\le y \\le 1.0$ and \n",
    "  - $1.0 \\le x \\le 9.0$. \n",
    "5. An agent entering the cliff zone is returned to the starting state.\n",
    "6. The agent moves 1.0 units per time step. \n",
    "7. The 8 possible **discrete actions** are moves in the following directions:  \n",
    "  - +x, \n",
    "  - +x, +y,\n",
    "  - +y\n",
    "  - -x, +y,\n",
    "  - -x,\n",
    "  - -x, -y,\n",
    "  - -y, and\n",
    "  - +x, -y. \n",
    "8. The rewards are:\n",
    "  - -1 for a time step in the state-space,\n",
    "  - -10 for colliding with an edge (barrier) of the state-space,\n",
    "  - -100 for falling off the cliff and returning to the starting state, and \n",
    "  - +1000 for reaching the terminal or goal state. \n",
