    "[**Value at Risk (VaR)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk) is a commonly used measure of financial risk. VaR is as an **order statistic**, being defined at a probability quantile $p$. For example, for the 1% var is there is a probability of $0.01$ that the loss will be at the lower 1% quantile of the returns or greater.      \n",
    "\n",
    "Returns of financial assets are well know to be non-Gaussian. This presents significant problems for analysis, including risk analysis. Many approaches have been used to create probability models which better represent the returns of financial assets.   \n",
    "\n",
    "One possibility is to use Gaussian mixture models to model the distribution of financial returns. In this assignment, you will model returns of the [S&P 500 Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index) using Gaussian mixture models and then compute the VaR.    \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** In this exercise you will work with daily returns and therefore daily VaR. You may not be familiar with the concept of returns. The return is the difference between the value from one period (day) to the next (day). A **positive return** means the asset has increased in value. Whereas, a **negative return** means the asset has decreased in value, and represent losses. It is these losses the VaR model seeks to quantify.     \n",
    "\n",
    "> More specifically, in this assignment you will work with log returns. Here the log returns are the returns of the log values of the series.         "
