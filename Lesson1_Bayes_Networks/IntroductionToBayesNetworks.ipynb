    "**Bayesian Networks** or **BNs** are one of the most important representations of probabilistic graphical models. BNs are **directed acyclic graphs** or **DAGs** which form a compact **representation** of a joint distribution. Schematically we can view the role of representation in an intelligent agent as shown in the figure below.\n",

    "<center> Representation in an intelligent agent </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The representation captures the **conditional independence structure** of the joint distribution. Taking advantage of the independency structure of the distribution can greatly reduce the computational complexity of inference for a graphical model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The directed nature of the BN can capture **causality**. **Influence** travels along the directed edges of the graph. However, keep in mind, information on independence can flow both directions along the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the directed edges, the **conditional marginal distribution** of each variable is only dependent on its **parents**. In other words, **belief** is propagated along the DAG from parents to children. In this sense, the DAG is a representation of a **generative sampling process**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical models allow us to add **evidence** as data is observed for certain variables. Further, we can perform **queries** on **hidden variables**, variables with no evidence. We will address queries and inference in another lesson.\n",

    "## Some graph terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the probabilistic graphical models let's examine some basic graph terminology. Graphs are are comprised of two types of elements:\n",
    "1. **Nodes** or **vertices** in probabilistic models contain the distribution information.\n",
    "2. **Edges** define the relationships between the nodes. Edges can be **directed** or **undirected**. Information flows in the direction specified along a directed edge. Undirected edges have no preferred direction of information flow. \n",
    "3. The set of edges of a graph (less nodes) is called the **skeleton**. \n",
    "4. Nodes connected by an edge are **neighbors**. \n",
    "5. The **degree** of a node is the number of neighbors. \n",
    "6. **Parents** are nodes with a directed edge to another node, know as the **child**. Parents are said to have **influence** on their children. \n",
    "7. **Ancestors** are nodes which are parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc, of a with a path of directed edges to a child. \n",
    "8. **Descendants** are nodes which receive information from parents or ancestors along a path of directed edges. For example, a child node is a descendant of its parents and grand parents. \n",
    "9. **Leaf** nodes have no directed edges to ancestors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can classify graphs by their topology. The figure below shows some basic graph types.   \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/GraphTypes.JPG\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:600px; height:200px\"/>\n",
    "<center> **Examples of basic graph types** </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Four graph types are illustrated in the figure above:   \n",
    "1. **Directed acyclic graph** is a graph where all edges are **directed** and there are no **cycles**. Information or **influence** flows in one direction along a directed edge. In the case illustrated, influence flows  $A \\rightarrow B$ and $C \\rightarrow B$, but not the other way. This makes $A$ and $C$ **ancestors** or **parents** of $B$.   \n",
    "2. **Directed cyclic graph** has directed edges but contains a cycle. A **cycle** is a directed path that starts and returns to the same node. In this case the illustrated case the cycle is $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow A$.\n",
    "3. **Undirected graph** has no directed edges. \n",
    "4. **Partially directed graph** has both directed and undirected edges. \n"

    "We have already worked on the student GRE score and letter problem. As a reminder, a student would like to make inferences or **queries** on the joint distribution $P(D,I,S,G,L,A)$. Her goal is to . She can make the following assertions about the independencies for this problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The degree of difficulty, D, of the machine learning course is **unconditionally independent** of all other variable, $\\{D \\bot I,S,G,L,A \\}$.\n",
    "2. The intelligence of the student is, I, **unconditionally independent** of all other variable, $\\{I \\bot D,S,G,L,A \\}$.\n",
    "3. The quality of the student's recommendation letter, L, is **conditionally independent**  of intelligence, her GRE score, and her letter, given her grade, $\\{L \\bot I,S,D,A\\ |\\ G\\}$.\n",
    "4. The student's grade in the machine learning course, G, is **conditionally independent** of her GRE score and her letter, give the difficulty of the course and her intelligence, $\\{G  \\bot S,L\\ |\\ I,D\\}$. \n",
    "5. The students GRE scores, S, are **conditionally independent** of her grade, difficulty of the course and letter, given her intelligence, $\\{S \\bot G,D,L\\ |\\ I\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these independecies, the distribution can be factored as follows:\n",

Once a value is assigned to B, A depends on B and C depends on B, but A and C are **decoupled**. The independency when B is observed is expressed, $A\\ \\bot\\ C\\ |\\ B$.\n",
    "2. **Evidential:** The independencies are the same as before, $A\\ \\bot\\ C\\ |\\ B$, just the direction of the influence changes, $C \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow A$. Once again, the evidence variable B separates A and C, just as they do in the causal case. In this case, **evidence** is added to the DAG which allows inference of A.   \n",
    "3. **Common Evidence, V-Structure, or Collider:** In this case, having evidence on B **blocks** the path or **separates** A from C, $A \\perp C\\ |\\ B$ . In other words, knowing B explains away A and C. \n",
    "4. **Common Cause or Common Parent:** Here, $B \\rightarrow A$ and $B \\rightarrow C$. In this case, B is causal to both A and C, making A and C independent, $A \\perp C$. However, if B is observed A and B can no longer be independent, $A \\not\\perp C\\ |\\ B$ "

    "Up to now we have only dealt with distributions of the variables in our graphical models. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that we will **observe** data values for some variables, which is typically referred to as **evidence**. Evidence provides specific values for **observable variables**. Once we have evidence, the size of the tables we must work with can be reduced. Only entries consistent with the evidence need be retained. Thus, computational complexity can be reduced, sometimes greatly. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of evidence might be a specific score $S$ on the GRE test for a student. If the score is high, $S^1$, then we need not consider table entries with a low GRE score $S^0$.\n",

    "Not all variables are observable however. We must estimate the marginal distribution of these **unobservable variables** given the evidence. We say that we perform a **query** on the unobservable variables. The query returns the marginal distribution of the variable. \n",

    "For example, human intelligence cannot be directly observed. In our student model, we might observe a student's GRE score as $S^1$ and course grade as $G^0$. Given this evidence, we can now query to compute the marginal posterior distribution of the student's intelligence. \n",

    "## Uncertain and unreliable evidence\n",

    "In the real world, evidence can be **uncertain** or **unreliable**. Both of these situations effect the marginal distribution returned by a query on any unobservable variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Uncertain evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's consider the effect of **uncertain evidence**. There are many situations in which uncertain evidence can arise. For example, an observer might only have a certain confidence in an observation. An ornithologist sees a bird, but may only be 70% certain of the species. The quality of the habitat (an unobservable) is a parent of species present. How can we include the uncertainty of the ornithologist's observation into the model? \n",
    "\n",
    "A model of habitat quality, $q$, given the species, $s$ can be written:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(q\\ |\\ s) = \\sum_s p(q,s\\ |\\ \\tilde{s}) = \\sum_s p(q\\ |\\ s, \\tilde{s})\\ p(s\\ |\\ \\tilde{s})$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $q$ is dependent on $s$ independent of the uncertainty of the observation $\\tilde{s}$, leading to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_s p(q\\ |\\ s)\\ p(s\\ |\\ \\tilde{s})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unreliable evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say our ornithologist decides her observations are going too slowly and decides to hire an assistant. Unfortunately, the person she hires has exaggerated his bird species identification skills. Thus, this observer is providing **unreliable evidence**. Unfortunately, the ornithologist must now apply a rather abstract and subjective treatment of this unreliable evidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ornithologist must replace the unreliable evidence with **virtual evidence** or **likelihood evidence**. Mathematically we can express this process as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(q\\ |\\ s) = \\frac{1}{Z} p(s\\ |\\ q)\\ p(q) \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{Z} p(H\\ |\\ q)\\ p(q)$$    \n",
    "\n",
    "where, $Z$ is a normalization or partition function, and $H$ is the fixed virtual evidence selected by the ornithologist. Since $p(H\\ |\\ q)$ is selected subjectively this cannot be treated as a proper probability distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The process of using virtual evidence is purely Bayesian. A frequentist would take one of two possible approaches. The simplest approach is simply to remove or **censor** the suspect values from the data set. Alternatively, the suspect values can be **confidence weighted** to account for the suspect values.  "
