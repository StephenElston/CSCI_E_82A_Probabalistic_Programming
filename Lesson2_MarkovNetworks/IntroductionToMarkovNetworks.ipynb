However, there is no unique representation of independencies. Many BNs can exhibit the same independency structure, but with different causal relationships. \n",

    "Now, we will turn our attention to another class of probabilistic graphical models known as **Markov networks** (**MNs**) or **Markov graphical models**, or **Markov random fields**. Markov graphic models are not directed graphs. Yet, like BNs, Markov graphical models can represent independencies of many probability distributions. \n",

However, this is not universally the case, and there are independencies which can only be represented by a MN, but not a BN or vice versa. Further, there are distribution which have indepenencies which cannot be modeled with either. \n",

    "You can develop a useful view of the relationship between BNs and MNs by transforming a directed graph into a MN. First, we need to introduce some definitions:  \n",

    "> **Definition:** A **moral graph**, $M(G)$, of a BN structure, $G$ is the **undirected graph** over $X$ that contains an undirected edge between $X$ and $Y$ if; a) there is a directed edge between $X$ and $Y$, or b) $X$ and $Y$ are both parents of the same note $Z$.\n",

    "2. The undirected **ancestral** graph is shown in the center. Since W has a blocked path in the DAG it is not part of the ancestral graph. U, X, Y and Z are all ancestors of W, and form the ancestral graph. \n",
    "3. We can make the following assertion about the DAG; $P(X,U\\ |\\ Z) = P(X\\ |\\ Z)\\ P( U\\ |\\ Z)$.  This situation is an **immorality** since X and U are parents of Z. In other words, X and U are independent given evidence Z, which **blocks** the path from X and U. \n",
    "4. The graph is **moralized** by adding an edge between X and U as shown on the right. \n",

As we have seen, the Markov network contains additional links from the moralization of the directed graph. As a result, independence information can be lost in the transformation in either direction. In addition, the undirected graph cannot represent the causality as is done in a DAG. \n",

However, the moralized Markov network shown on the right has only a single clique $\\phi(X,Y,Z)$. This MN representation does not allow us to infer the relationship $X\\ \\bot\\ Y$.   \n",
