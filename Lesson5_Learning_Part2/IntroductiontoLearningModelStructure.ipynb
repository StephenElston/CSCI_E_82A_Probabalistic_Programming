However, there are many cases where this structure may not be known a priori. In this lesson we will focus on algorithms for **learning model structure**.

    "The goal of probabilistic network structure learning is to determine the independencies in the distribution of the data. The independencies determine the structure of the graph.

    "## Problems of Structure Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding graphical model the structure from data is a complex problem. The goal is to find a graph structure which best represents the independencies of the distribution of the data. This is accomplished by searching through possible graph structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding graph structure can be used as a data mining method. However, searching for graph structure is not without some serious pitfalls. The result is that any structure determined from a finite quantity of data is approximate at best. Interpretation of any relationships found in resulting graph structures should be done with caution. \n",

    "1. **Constraints** on the search. A common constraint is on the number of parents of each node. Another common constraint is to assume the graph is a tree.\n",

    "### I-equivalence and Ambiguity in Graph Structure Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons we have seen that the graphs representing an I-map of a distribution are not unique. From another perspective, we can say that it is possible for several DAGs to exhibit Markov equivalence. These facts mean that there is ambiguity in the determination of graph structure from data. It should not come as a surprise that several DASs exhibit nearly the same fit to a set of data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A further, and often more significant problem in practice,  is that with limited amounts of data determination of independencies is error prone. In fact, it will often be the case that any pair of variables in a finite size dataset will show some dependencies. \n",

    "## PC Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the oldest algorithms for finding network structure is the **PC algorithm**. The PC algorithm is a locally greedy search algorithm for determining the structure of Bayesian networks. The PC algorithm is a two step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The skeleton of the graph is determined.\n",
    "- The direction of the edges is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PC algorithm uses **constraint satisfaction search** methods. Constraint satisfaction search is a classic artificial intelligence learning method. The constraint satisfaction search problem predates the computer era. Frances Guthrie applied the method to the 4 color map problem in 1852. Constraint satisfaction search methods were applied in artificial intelligence starting in the early 1960s. For readable discussion of the constraint satisfaction search methods in artificial intelligence see Chapter 6 of Russell and Norvig, third edition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The determination of the skeleton can be done in a number of ways. One approach is using greedy elimination:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with a fully connected network. \n",
    "- Find the a connection with $x \\bot y\\ |\\ \\oslash$ using a **mutual information criteria**. That is $x$ and $y$ are independent. A Chi Squared significance test is used to determine set a cut-off for independence.\n",
    "- Repeat the above step until the algorithm terminates when the number of connections per node is at or below a predetermined threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the skeleton determined, the directions of the edges must be determined. For three variables $x$, $y$ and $z$ this can be done using the independencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\bot y\\ |\\ \\oslash \\Rightarrow x\\ y\\ are\\ parents\\ of\\ z$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$x \\bot y\\ |\\ z \\Rightarrow z\\ is\\ parent\\ of x\\ and\\ y$$\n",

    "## Hill Climb Search\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used search method is **hill climbing**, also known as the **method of steepest ascent**. Hill climbing is applied in a number of  There are a number of variations. In general, this search method is a **locally greedy** approach to improving an **objective function**, $f(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the structure of graphical models, the objective function is some measure of the **divergence** between the distribution of the data and the distribution represented by the graph. Finding graph structure is a search of discrete states. These states correspond to the presence or absence of edges between the nodes.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The hill climb search proceeds through a series of discrete states to find the terminal state. The search continues until the improvement in the objective function is less than some threshold. There are several commonly used variants to find the locally greedy improvement including:\n",
    "1. The closest state which improves the objective function is taken as the next step.  \n",
    "2. The successor state with the largest possible improvement is taken at each step.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As with all locally greedy methods, hill climb search can become stuck at **local optimum**. Some more sophisticated variations use stochastic sampling methods to try to overcome this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional details on the hill climbing algorithm can be found in Section 4.1.1 of Russell and Norvig, third edition. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Another commonly used search method is taboo search. This algorithm was developed by Fred Glover in the late 1980s as a mixed integer programming method. For many, but not all, problems taboo search can outperform hill climbing. Taboo search keeps a list of already visited states and prevents the algorithm from revisiting these states. Further, taboo search will accept moves that decrease the objective function if all other states are blocked. In this way, taboo search promotes **exploration** of the space. However, maintaining the taboo list can require prohibitive amounts of memory. You can find a readable introduction to this algorithm in [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search)."

    "- The higher the likelihood, the lower the BIC. Models with lower BIC are considered better. \n",
    "- The larger the number of parameters the higher the BIC. Thus, BIC penalizes complex models and prefers simple models with few edges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "BIC is used a model scoring method in conjunction with a search method. For example, the BIC can be used as an objective function for determining if an edge should or should not be in the graph. Strictly speaking, the negative of the BIC is used with the hill climbing algorithm. \n",

    "## The K2 Score method\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to model scoring is the **K2 algorithm** or **K2 score method**. The K2 algorithm uses a greedy search, such as hill climbing, and proceeds by the following steps:   \n",
    "1. The nodes are ordered. The search will follow this ordering.   \n",
    "2. The search begins begins with the first node in the order, which initially has no parents.   \n",
    "3. Parents are added incrementally in the order that the action increases the score the most.  \n",
    "4. The search terminates when the score no longer increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of scoring metrics have been used with the K2 algorithm. The most commonly used is the **Bayesian score**. For a graph, $\\mathcal{G}$, and $n$ dimensional data $D$ sampled from the joint distribution we can apply Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(D\\ |\\ \\mathcal{G}) = \\frac{p(\\mathcal{G}\\ |\\ D) p(\\mathcal{G})}{p(D)} = \\frac{p(\\mathcal{G}, D)}{p(D)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The prior distribution, is typically a uniform Dirichlet, unless we have some reason to bias the solution toward a particular structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since $p(D)$ is the same for all graph structures we can use either the marginal likelihood, $p(\\mathcal{G}\\ |\\ D)$, or the joint posterior probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assume the parameters associated with each variable in the graph are independent, the K2 metric can be decomposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\mathcal{G}, D) = p(\\mathcal{G}) \\prod_{i=1}^n g(d_i, \\mathbf{P_{a_i}})\\\\ \n",
    "where\\\\\n",
    "g(d_i, \\mathbf{P_{a_i}}) = subscore\\ of\\ ith\\ dimension$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This decomposition allows the search algorithm to find the maximum score variable by variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The requirement to select a good search order of the nodes can lead to difficulties applying the K2 algorithm in practice. A number of random starts can be used to used to try different node orderings. \n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of the K2 method is that no restrictions need be applied to the number of parents of a node. The constraints for the search arise from the initial node ordering. \n",

Second, mutual information is symmetric: $I(X;Y) = I(Y;X)$. We can also relate mutual information to entropy, conditional entropy and joint entropy as follows:\n",
