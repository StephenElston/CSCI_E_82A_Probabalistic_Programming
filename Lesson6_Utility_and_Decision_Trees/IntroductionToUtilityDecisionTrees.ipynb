    "In this lesson we will start our study of **planning methods**. By planning we mean methods an **agent** which uses a **model of the environment** to find an **optimal sequence of decisions** when faced with **uncertain**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of planning methods have been developed, starting in the 1940's. These early planning theories were intended to optimize the production and use of industrial resources during the Second World War.\n",

    "A schematic diagram of our planning **agent** and its interaction with the **environment** is shown in the figure below. \n",

    "<img src=\"img/AgentEnvironment.JPG\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:500px; height:300px\"/>\n",
    "<center> **Interaction of agent and environment** </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This model of the interaction shown between the intelligent agent and the environment applies to a number of machine intelligence situations. There are three points of interaction between the agent and the environment. This separation between the intelligent agent and the environment is defined by these interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **state** of the environment is **observed** by the agent. The **sensors** used to observe state are part of the environment and not the agent. \n",
    "2. A method by which the agent can cause **actions** in the environment. The actuators which carry out the agent's commands are part of the environment and not the agent. \n",
    "3. Rewards provide the agent **feedback** on the **value** or **utility** of the state of the environment. The reward is generated in the environment and not the agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there is strict division between the agent and the environment. The agent provides the intelligence. All other activities occur in the environment. This division is necessary so that intelligence is separate from any activity in the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example of an intelligence agent, your prefrontal cortex, and your environment. In this case you must perform a number of task to start at home, perform your job, get paid, your reward, and return home. This plan requires a great number of interactions with the environment and decisions including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your prefrontal cortex must decide when to leave. This agent commands some actuators, fingers, to tap your phone and your sensors, optic nerves, observe the bus schedule. Based on past experience, the agent knows there is a high probability the bus will run late. To avoid the negative reward of arriving late an earlier bus is chosen. \n",
    "2. As you leave the house, the agent uses actuators of the hands and fingers and sensors, the optic nerves to ensure you have your keys. \n",
    "3. Many more steps involve getting to work. Another set of tasks are required to perform your job, perhaps eat some lunch with a friend, and return home. \n",
    "4. Ultimately, your prefrontal cortex uses sensors and actuators to examine a bank account and see the change of state when you get paid. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above scenario notice that the agent performs no action and collects no state information. Rather, this agent controls the actuators and uses sensors to find the state of the environment and receive the reward."

    "## Basics of Utility Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "To make optimal decisions an intelligent agent must have a way to measure the value of the outcomes. Creating functions to measure the value of outcomes is the domain of **utility theory**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example. Let's say that you go to a charity dinner and you buy a raffle ticket to win a prize worth \\\\$1,000. There are 100 tickets and each ticket costs \\\\$100. Your joy of supporting this important charity is worth 200 to you. What is your utility of buying one ticket:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(1) = -p(buy) * cost + p(feeling) * value + p(win) * win\\ amount \\\\\n",
    "= - 1.0 * 100 + 1.0 * 200 + 0.01 * 1000 \\\\\n",
    "= 110$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the foregoing example you can likely see that the general form of a utility function can be expressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(S) = \\sum_{s} p(s)\\ u(s)\\\\\n",
    "where\\\\\n",
    "p(s) = probability\\ of\\ state\\ s\\\\\n",
    "u(s) = utility\\ of\\ state\\ s $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue with the example. There is no reason that a utility function should have linear scaling. To understand this consider what your utility will be if you buy two raffle tickets. Your cost is now $200 for the tickets, and you have doubled your chance of winning the prize. You might think that your utility might be only 20. But, perhaps not. Your joy at helping the charity might be 300 for your larger donation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(2) = - 1.0 * 2 * 100 + 1.0 * 300 + 0.01 * 2 * 1000 \\\\\n",
    "= 120$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above, you can see that **amount of money does not equal utility**. To understand this concept consider the following situation. In his youth, your instructor took many long backpacking trips. The person who organized the food for one 5-day hike did a poor job. Meals were minimal, and by the last day, there was no food left at all. We arrived in Aspen Colorado in mid afternoon quite hungry. We found a popular hamburger restaurant and spent the very last bit of money to buy a hamburger. The utility of that hamburger was much greater than the price paid. Then as now, Aspen is a playground of the wealthy. It is very likely that the utility of a hamburger to these wealthy customers was considerably less than too a young man who has not had enough to eat for several days!  "

    "## Actions and Expected Utility\n",
    "\n",
    "In rational decision making the goal is to find actions that **maximize utility**. The utility of states must honor the following **constraints** given the preferences:   \n",
    "\n",
    "- $U(A) \\gt U(B)$, if and only if, $A \\succ B$.\n",
    "- $U(A) = U(B)$, if and only if, $A \\sim B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By itself, a utility function does not tell us anything about the results of **actions** the agent might take. The **expected utility function** is the product of the value of a state multiplied by the probability of being in a state given the observation and the action:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E \\big[ U(a\\ |\\ o) \\big] = \\sum_{s'} p(s'\\ |\\ a,o)\\ U(s') $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a planning problem we want to find the **optimal action**, $a$, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$argmax_a E \\big[ U(a\\ |\\ o) \\big] = argmax_a \\sum_{s'} p(s'\\ |\\ a,o)\\ U(s') $$\n",
    "\n",
    "While simple conceptually, directly applying the above formulation to solve for the optimal action can be difficult beyond the simplest problems. An example of such a problem can be represented as a **decision tree**, which allows relatively direct solution. However, using this representation is limited both by intellectual capacity and computational complexity. We will not go further down this path. You can see some more detail along with some examples in Section 7.2 in Barber. "

    "## Influence Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons we have investigated the use of Bayesian networks as a representation of probability distributions and their independencies. We can extend this representation to become **influence diagrams**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A representation for a decision process must preserve **causality**. A decision cannot be made until previous decisions have been made and resulting state is observed. Bayesian networks represent causality or influence of one set of variables to others. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two additional elements that must be added to Bayesian networks to transform them to influence diagrams:\n",
    "1. Decision nodes which have no distribution. In effect, the decision nodes are like switches which initiate actions in the environment. We illustrate decisions nodes as rectangles. \n",
    "2. Utility nodes, which measures the value of the states of the environment. We illustrate utility nodes as diamonds. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also need three types of directed edges to specify influence diagrams. \n",
    "- Edges that **propagate belief**, or conditional information as we used before. \n",
    "- **Informational edges** which propagate information that is not related to a distribution or belief.\n",
    "- **Functional edges** which end in utility nodes which propagate the information needed for the utility calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a few simple cases that occur in influence diagrams. As illustrated in the diagram below a random variable in an influence diagram can be dependent on both other random variables as well as decisions. We have already spent considerable time on dependencies and independencies of random variables. But consider what happens when a decision is imposed. The decision will force the probabilities of some states to 0. That is, a decision allows some states but not others to occur. \n",

    "In the above diagram notice that the edge between the decision and the random variable is shown as an **information link**. This is because, decisions have no distributions associated with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows how a utility node can be dependent on both random variables and decision nodes. We have already discussed how a probability distribution is used to compute utility. A decision will fix the set of states which are possible and therefore the total utility. \n",

    "## Inference on Influence Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons, we explored a number of widely used exact inference methods for Bayesian belief networks. It turns out that many of the inference methods for Bayesian networks, like variable elimination, belief propagation, and the junction tree algorithm, can be applied to the case of influence diagrams as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will only touch on the variable elimination method. Variable elimination for influence diagrams follows a similar process as for Bayesian networks. The difference being that we proceed in the reverse of the partial ordering.   \n",

    "There is one factorization we can apply to variable elimination on influence diagrams to simplify the problem. We can take advantage of the fact that early decisions are **independent** of latter decisions since the later decisions are not yet known. Thus, in many cases we can simply sum the marginal utilities.\n",
