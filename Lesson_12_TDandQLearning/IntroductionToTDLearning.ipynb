    "In the previous lesson we explored Monte Carlo **reinforcement learning**. MC RL required that the returns for an entire episode be computed before any values are available for use. The disadvantage of this approach is the the full set of returns are required for state value or action value estimates. But, how can we get state values or action-values in fewer time steps? It turns out there are algorithms which compute estimates in as few as one step. In this lesson will focus on a state-value estimation algorithm known as **time difference learning** or **TD-learning** and control algorithm known as **SARSA**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that reinforcement learning has several distinctive characteristics, which differentiate this method from other machine learning and dynamic programming:\n",
    "- **No Markov model** needs to be specified for reinforcement learning, in contrast to dynamic programming.\n",
    "- Like dynamic programming, reinforcement learning **optimizes a reward function**. This is in contrast to supervised and unsupervised learning which use an error or objective function.  \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning algorithms learn by **experience**. Over time, the algorithm learns a model of the environment and these results are used to optimize the expected reward. Learning from experience is in contrast to supervised learning which uses known marked cases. \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning agents take **actions** and only receive **state** and **rewards** from the environment. These are the only interaction between the RL agent and the environment.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction between a reinforcement learning agent and the environment are illustrated in the figure below. Notice that the only feedback the agent receives from the environment is reward and state.   \n",

    "The ability to learn from experience is an attractive concept. This method of learning seems to mimic human learning. However, reinforcement learning has proven difficult to use in real-world applications. For a review of successes and problems arising when applying RL to robotics see [Kobler et. al.](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Publications/Kober_IJRR_2013.pdf). At the present time, RL has mostly succeeded in cases where simulations can be used to gain experience. \n",

    "## TD Prediction Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous lesson we examined a general update model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$NewValue = OldValue + LearningRate * ErrorTerm$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this general formulation the update for TD state value can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{t+1}(S_{t}) = V_t(S_t) + \\alpha \\big[ G_t - V_t(S_t) \\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here,   \n",
    "$\\alpha = $ the learning rate,      \n",
    "$\\big[ G_t - V_t(S_t) \\big] = $ the TD error term is the difference between the return $G_t$ and the value, $V(S_t)$. The return is identical to the state value at convergence, making the error 0.   \n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "Using the same general formulation we can create and single time step update model know as the **one step time difference** or **TD(0)** algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{t+1}(S_{t}) = V_t(S_t) + \\alpha \\big[ R_{t+1} + V_{t+1}(S_{t+1}) - V_t(S_t) \\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,  \n",
    "$\\delta_t =  R_{t+1} + V_{t+1}(S_{t+1}) - V_t(S_t) = $ the one-step **TD error**,  \n",
    "$R_{t+1} = $ the return for the next time step,   \n",
    "$V_t(S_t) = $ is the state-value at time step t,   \n",
    "$V_{t+1}(S_{t+1}) = $ the bootstrap state-value for the successor state, $S_{t+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like dynamic programming algorithms, the TD algorithm **bootstraps**. The return and estimated value at the next time step, $V_{t+1}(S_{t+1})$, are from previous samples. However, unlike MC RL which does not bootstrap, the TD(0) algorithm produces an estimate of $V_{t+1}(S_t)$ in only one time step, rather than waiting to reach the terminal state at the end of the episode. This fact can be seen by examining the backup diagram shown below:\n",

    "## Example of Time Difference RL\n",
    "\n",
    "With this short introduction TD RL in mind, let's try an example. We will sample the value function using a basic TD(0) algorithm here. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in other labs, **Navigation** to a goal is a significant problem in robotics. Real-world navigation is rather complex. Therefore, in this example we will use a simple analog called a **grid world**. The grid world for this problem is shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/GridWorld.JPG\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:200px; height:200px\"/>\n",
    "<center> **A 4x4 Grid World with Terminal State** </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid world consists of a 4x4 set of positions the robot can occupy. Each position is considered a state. The goal is to navigate to state 0, the goal, in the minimum steps. We will explore methods to find policies which reach this goal and achieve maximum reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grid position 0 is the goal and a **terminal state**. There are no possible state transitions out of this position. The presence of a terminal state makes this an **episodic Markov random process**. For each episode sampled the robot can start in any other random position, $\\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 \\}$. This random selection process makes this a **random start** TD algorithm. The episode terminates when the robot enters the terminal position (state 0).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, an RL agent may need to explore to find the possible actions when it is in some particular state. To simplify our example, we encode, or represent, these possibilities in a dictionary as shown in the code block below. We use a dictionary of dictionaries to perform the lookup. The keys of the outer dictionary are the identifiers (numbers) of the states. The keys of the inner dictionary are the possible actions and the values are the **successor state**, $s'$, for that transition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In each state, there are four possible actions the robot can take:\n",
    "- up, u\n",
    "- down, d,\n",
    "- left, l\n",
    "- right, r\n",
    "\n",
    "The TD RL agent has no model for the environment. Therefore, beyond these allowed actions, all other information is encapsulated in the environment and is unobservable by the agent. This is the key difference between reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. "

    "For n-step off-policy learning we update a target policy $\\pi(A_t|S_t)$ using samples from a behavior policy $b(A_t|S_t)$. Since the two policies differ, the probabilities of an action given the state will undoubtedly differ. For example, the behavior policy can be exploratory whereas, the target policy is greedy. \n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the different probabilities of sampling we reweight by the **importance sampling ratio**. For an n-step algorithm at time step $t$ the importance sampling ratio can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_{t:t + n -1} = \\prod_{k=\\tau}^{min(t + n -1,T-1)} \\frac{\\pi(A_k|S_k)}{b(A_k|S_k)}$$\n",

    "For both of the above update equations consider the effect of importance sampling ratio. If the action given state is more likely under the target policy that the behavior policy, more weight is given to updating with the error term. However, If the action given state is less likely under the target policy that the behavior policy, less weight is given to updating with the error term. In this way, the weighting by the importance sampling ratio gives the correct updates for the target policy regardless of the transition probabilities of the behavior policy. \n",
